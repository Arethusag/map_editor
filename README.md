# Map Editor

This project is a proof of concept that demonstrates a tiled sprite map can be represented entirely as a data base schema. We show that a schema containing cartesian (X, Y) coordinates and a Tile ID provides sufficient information to a render engine to construct the sprite map while leaving the option of extending tile properties through additional relationships. We construct an example written in C using SQLite and OpenGL libraries.
